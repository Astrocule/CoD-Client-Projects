If you would like a new client or Linux distribution to be supported, please make a request in the issues tab. I am updating this repo as I go along, things may move or change.

TBA:
* Launcher for all clients in one (Linux/Handheld devices)
* Docker images for clients
* Ptero/Pelican eggs for clients
* Uhhhh I ran out of ideas and im lazy :P
